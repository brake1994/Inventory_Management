# Inventory_Management
My first Java application and first experience developing GUI.

The application is an inventory management system that stores two type of objects, parts and products. Products are composed of parts. 
For example a bicycle (product) would have wheels, brakes, handlebars, etc. (parts).

The current version of the application has no save functionality. All data is only saved during runtime and lost when the application is closed.
